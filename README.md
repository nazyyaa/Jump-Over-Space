# 2D Platform Game

## Project Overview
This project features a **2D platform game** that meets several key challenges:
- Work with colors
- Keyboard control (no Enter needed)
- Multiple levels
- Time-based gameplay (the game changes over time)

## Gameplay Description

In this 2D platform game, the player controls a character navigating through various levels composed of platforms (lanes) and bonuses.

The core gameplay revolves around a unique mechanic: **gravity switching**. Players use the arrow keys for lateral movement across platforms and press the spacebar to invert the direction of gravity, either rising or falling within the game frame.

Each level presents a series of **static platforms**, which are randomly generated in position and length. This randomness adds variety and challenge to each playthrough. The player's objective is to **collect all bonuses** scattered across the level. These bonuses are strategically placed, requiring careful movement and gravity manipulation to reach.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- As the player moves and switches gravity, they must stay on the platforms. Falling off the platforms or hitting the top or bottom of the screen results in losing the game.
- Each level has a **time limit**, adding pressure for the player to move quickly and efficiently. The primary goal is to collect all bonuses before time runs out.

## Game Features
- **Increasing complexity**: The game becomes more challenging with each level, introducing more platforms and bonuses. This requires more precise control and strategy.
- **Simple, terminal-based graphics**: The focus is on the core gameplay mechanics, offering a retro gaming experience.
- **Strategy and reflexes**: The game is as much about **planning and strategy** as it is about **quick reflexes** and **fast reactions**, providing a balanced challenge for a wide range of players.

## Game Flow
1. **Title Screen**: Players are greeted with the game's name and instructions.
2. **Menu Screen**: The menu allows players to choose from three levels or exit the game.
3. **Gameplay Screen**: Once a level is selected, players enter the gameplay screen, where they control a character in a 2D space. They navigate platforms, collect bonuses, and avoid falling off the screen.
4. **Time Pressure**: A countdown timer is displayed, adding urgency to the gameplay.
5. **Winner/Loser Screens**: If the player collects all bonuses within the time limit, a **winner** screen appears. Otherwise, a **game-over** screen is shown.
